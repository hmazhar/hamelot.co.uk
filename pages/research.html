<h3>Simulation of anchoring system on a Near Earth Object [NEO] in a low G environment</h3>

    <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0">
      <tr>
        <td width="50%"><p>This research investigates an approach used to simulate and  validate a   simulation capability that is able to simulate granular dynamics    simulations with millions of objects. This massively parallel granular   dynamics  framework relies on ubiquitous  Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)   cards that are capable of performing trillions  of floating point   operations per second and can simultaneously process hundreds  of   computational threads, making them ideally suited for the task at hand.   Utilizing  a variety of experimental data, the simulation capability was   validated with  existing literature. Tests included a lift/drag and   ball drop test in a bed of  granular material, a steady state vibration   test, a brazil nut test and a  penetration test. This  parallel   simulation capability was used to investigate two types of anchoring    systems, and inflatable anchor and a helical anchor, when deployed on a   Near  Earth Object (NEO) in a low gravity environment. In order to   successfully simulate  the anchor and granular material in this   environment, the simulation capability  was augmented with a cohesion   model capable of capturing the necessary behavior  and short range   forces associated with NEOs. The goal of this effort is to   experimentally validate the simulation capability and determine which   anchor design is most promising. </p></td>

    <h2>Optimization of parallel LCP solver</h2>
    <h5>The simulation engine used: Chrono::Engine contains a parallel iterative LCP solver that runs on the GPU. </h5>
    <h5>&nbsp;</h5>
    <h5>The previous implementation of the solver relied on precomputing several matricies and storing them on the GPU. While this approach saves on overall computation cost it greatly increased memory usage. This reduced the total amount of objects one GPU could simulate. The solver was re-written so that memory acceses were minimized at the cost of performing additional computations. Additionally work that could be performed duing the collision detection step was removed to reduce overall register usage. To optimize the matrix math within the kernel, Maple was used to perform the symbolic computation. Maple was then used to convert the final expression into optimized C code that minimixed mathematical operations and increased data reuse. </h5>
