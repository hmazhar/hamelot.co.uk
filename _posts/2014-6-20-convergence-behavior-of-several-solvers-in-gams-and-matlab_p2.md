In this post I wanted to document the difference between the cadoux model and the chrono model for a few simple test cases. 


##Test Problems

###Ball sliding on plane
In this test problem there is a ball in perfect contact with a plane, the ball has an initial velocity of $$ -2 \frac{m}{s}$$ in the $$x$$ direction. friction is .1, step size = .005, with a step size of .01, path returns a weird solution.
