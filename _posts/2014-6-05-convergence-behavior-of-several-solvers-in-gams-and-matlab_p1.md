In this post I wanted to document the behavior of several different numerical methods using a set of benchmark test problems. 

###Test Problems

 - Ball sliding on plane
 - Block sliding on plane
 - Block sliding from rest on incline $$65^\circ$$
 - Block coming to resting on incline $$25^\circ$$
 - Ball falling on stack of 20 balls

###Solvers

| Solver (Matlab)    || Solver (Gams) |
|--------------------||---------------|
| Nesterov           || Conopt        |
| Barzilai-Borwein   || IPopt         |
| Jacobi             || Path          |

##Test Problems

###Ball sliding on plane
In this test problem there is a ball in perfect contact with a plane, the ball has an initial velocity of $$ -2 \frac{m}{s}$$ in the $$x$$ direction. friction is .1, step size = .005, with a step size of .01, path returns a weird solution.
