## Original Reference
The Minkowski Portal Refinement method, also known as [XenoCollide](http://xenocollide.snethen.com/) was developed by Gary Snethen (Xeno). As far as I know the original implementation in 3D is only described in [Game Programming Gems 7](http://www.amazon.com/Game-Programming-Gems-Series/dp/1584505273) where working source code was also provided.


## Source Code

As of this writing these are the main implementations that I found online:

#### LibCCD

Library for collision detection between two convex shapes

- [LibCCD](http://libccd.danfis.cz/)
- [LibCCD Github](https://github.com/danfis/libccd)


#### Jitter Physics

Jitter physics is a realtime physics engine for .Net

- [Jitter Physics](http://jitter-physics.com)
- [Jitter Physics Code](https://code.google.com/p/jitterphysics/)
- [Jitter Physics MPR Code](https://code.google.com/p/jitterphysics/source/browse/trunk/Jitter/Collision/XenoCollide.cs)

#### MPR2D

A 2D Implementation of the Minkowski Portal Refinement (MPR) Algorithm

[MPR2D Code](https://code.google.com/p/mpr2d/)

#### MPR Ruby

A demonstration of the Minkowski Portal Refinement algorithm written in Ruby
