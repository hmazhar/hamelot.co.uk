In this post I wanted to document the behavior of several different numerical methods along with a set of benchmark test problems. 

###Test Problems

 - Ball sliding on plane
 - Block sliding on plane
 - Block resting on incline $$25^\circ$$
 - Block resting on incline $$45^\circ$$
 - Block resting on incline $$65^\circ$$
 - Stack of balls

Gams does not provide information about each individual iteration, therefore multiple gams runs are performed with increasing max iteration values. 


##Test Problems

###Ball sliding on plane
In this test problem there is a ball in perfect contact with a plane, the ball has an initial velocity of $$ -2 \frac{m}{s}$$ in the $$x$$ direction.
